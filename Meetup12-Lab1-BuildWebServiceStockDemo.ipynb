This is because we ran `az ml env setup ...` *without* the `--cluster` argument, which means the service was created locally. This can be useful for the purpose of testing the service as we develop our application. In a future lab, the same service will be deployed remotely to Azure Container Service and will be visible from the Azure portal.\n",
